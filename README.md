# sit-down-scheduler
A scheduler app to help my high school's IT department organize table for whole-school dinners

General goal: organize students and faculty into tables such that each table has roughly equal proportion of boys and girls from each of the 4 grades.
Metric: to minimize the sum of the standard deviations of the 8 data points at each table.
